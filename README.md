## Project Description
Community Connect is a website that allows for aspiring volunteers to find and bookmark upcoming community service events in their area. This website consolidates community service events to make them easily accessible as opposed to having to search for individual events across websites of multiple organizations, or having to filter through many unrelated events on a website such as Facebook Events. Community Connect also allows users to filter events through categories in order to find events that are specifically dedicated to beautification, charity, fundraising, and more. Community Connect will make it easier than ever for you to connect with your community, and leave a lasting and positive impact!
